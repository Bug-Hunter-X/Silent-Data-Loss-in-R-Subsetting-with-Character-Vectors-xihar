This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R related to subsetting data frames using character vectors. When attempting to subset rows based on a character vector containing values not present in the data frame's column, R silently omits these values without throwing any errors. This can lead to significant data loss or unexpected behavior without any warning to the user. The `bug.R` file showcases the erroneous behavior and `bugSolution.R` provides a solution to catch and handle these situations.
